This project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes (Source and Destination).
Currently, there are 30 cities listed in cities.json. You can add more cities if needed to expand the options.

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:

âœ… Notes:

1. Make sure your Python environment is active before installing dependencies.
2. Double-check that cities.json is in the same directory as app.py.
